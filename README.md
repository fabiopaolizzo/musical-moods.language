# MUSICAL-MOODS: Language Data

This repository contains the natural language data component of the MUSICAL-MOODS project, a foundational resource for training and validating AI models on complex, subjective, and unstructured human data.

**For a full overview of the project, please see the [central project hub](https://github.com/fabiopaolizzo/musical-moods.main).**

### Data Description

The data in this repository consists of transcripts from semi-structured interviews conducted with professional dancers immediately following each improvisation session. The content includes the dancers' reflections on their emotional state (mood), creative process, and physical experience during the interaction with the generative music system.

The data is provided in NLP-ready formats (e.g., `.txt` files) and serves as the "ground truth" for the subjective experiences being modeled.

### Potential Applications & Research Areas

This dataset is a rich resource for research in computational linguistics and behavioral modeling. It is particularly well-suited for developing and benchmarking models in:

-   **Sentiment Analysis & Affective Computing:** Classifying and predicting nuanced emotional states from text.
-   **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Modeling the semantics of human creative and emotional expression.
-   **Topic Modeling:** Discovering latent themes in subjective reflections.
